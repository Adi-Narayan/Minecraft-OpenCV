# Minecraft-OpenCV

This repo contains a python script that'll help you play minecraft without a keyboard or a mouse. This is a project that was inspired by the youtuber and content creator Fundy. This project uses OpenCV and the Mediapipe library. It uses pose detection and determines the pose of the user wherein it triggers certain keyboard and mouse inputs. 
To implement this feature, go to Options -> Controls -> Mouse -> Raw input -> OFF
